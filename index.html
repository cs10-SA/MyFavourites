    <h2>Reading</h2>

      I enjoy reading because it helps me relax and it is an activity I like
      doing in my free time. I particularly enjoy novels that make me feel like
      I am in a different place or time. My favourite books are probably the
      Harry Potter series, the Hunger Games and Dry. Though I enjoy many
      different genres of books, I do like dystopian or fantasy novels.

    <h2>Bubble Tea</h2>

      Bubble tea is always a refreshing and delicious drink no matter the
      season. It is a drink that is unique for the small tapioca bobas (the best
      part) it contains. Bubble tea originated in the 1980's in Taiwan but it is
      now a popular drink all across the world! My favourite flavours of bubble
      tea are tiramisu milk tea, taro and the original brown sugar.

      I love hiking because it allows me to enjoy the sights and sounds of
      nature while allowing me to challenge myself. It makes me  embrace my sense of
      adventure because sometimes I have to face my fears or get out of my comfort zone. Here are some of my favourite hikes that I have completed:
